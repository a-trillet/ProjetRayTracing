This code works in two parts:
main.py :   constains all the mains that can be commented easily in the end of the file.
            You might need to have more than one core to run this one as it is using multiprocessing
data.py :   interface that uses precomputed results to allow the user to experience with placing several antennas himself
            You will need all the saves files
